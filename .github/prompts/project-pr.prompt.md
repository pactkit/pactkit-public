# Command: PR (v1.4.0)
- **Usage**: `/project-pr`
- **Agent**: Repo Maintainer

## 🧠 Phase 0: Pre-flight Check
1.  **Branch Check**:
    - Run `git branch --show-current` to get current branch name
    - If branch is `main` or `master`: print "Skipping PR: working on main branch" and do not push or create a PR.
2.  **Existing PR Check**:
    - Run `gh pr list --head <branch> --state open --json number` to check for existing PR
    - If PR exists: print "PR already open: <URL>" and do not create a duplicate.
    - If `gh` CLI is unavailable: print "⚠️ gh CLI not available — cannot create PR"; do not push solely for this command, but still provide the prepared title/body and diagnostics.
3.  **Story Detection**: Infer active Story ID from branch name (e.g., `feature/STORY-051-desc` → `STORY-051`).

## 🎬 Phase 1: Push Assurance
1.  **Check Remote**: If remote tracking branch does not exist, run `git push -u origin <branch>`.
2.  **If push fails**: Do not create the PR. Report the error and preserve the local branch for retry.

## 🎬 Phase 2: PR Generation
0.  **Authorization (ask-first)**: creating the PR is an external-effect
    operation. Confirm with the user, then run `pactkit gate authorize pr`
    to open the audited window before `gh pr create` (the auth-gate hook
    blocks it otherwise).
1.  **Generate PR Title**: Format `{type}({scope}): {spec_title}`
    - `type`: `feat` for STORY, `fix` for BUG/HOTFIX
    - `scope`: infer from primary modified directory
    - `spec_title`: extract from `# {ID}: {Title}` heading in Spec (strip the ID prefix)
    - Max 70 characters
2.  **Generate PR Body**: Extract from Spec and test results:
    ```markdown
    ## Summary
    {1-3 sentences from Spec ## Background}

    ## Changes
    {R1, R2, ... from Spec ## Requirements, one bullet each with MUST/SHOULD/MAY}

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    {AC1, AC2, ... as checklist items — mark [x] if a test for it passed}

    ## Test Results
    - Unit: {N} passed, {N} failed
    - E2E: {N} passed, {N} failed

    ## Spec
    - [{STORY_ID}](docs/specs/{STORY_ID}.md)

    🤖 Generated with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
    ```
3.  **User Confirmation**: Show the PR title + body preview. Ask: "Create this PR? (yes/no/edit)"
    - `yes` → execute `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."`
    - `no` → skip
    - `edit` → accept user feedback, regenerate, ask again
4.  **Output**: Print PR URL on success.

## Rules Reference

# PDCA Lifecycle

## Entry
Activate a phase only when the user invokes its skill or explicitly asks for
that workflow. Resolve the current objective, project root, and relevant Story
from the current request and repository evidence; old run state is advisory.

## Execution
Work in the current conversation. Reuse valid evidence already produced in this
session. Do not repeat a completed step unless inputs changed or verification
shows a reason. Ask only when a missing decision would materially change the
result or authorize an external or destructive action.

## Reuse Classification
Before repeating a load, decision, or verification, classify what is available:
- Availability: content is present in context from a source still authoritative for this
  version; remembering a filename or a past read is not availability.
- Applicability: the change actually triggers the requirement; "simple task", an exhausted
  guide budget, and familiarity never justify skipping an applicable one.
- Decisions: a still-applicable decision may be reused; a decision is not verification.
- Evidence: reuse a verification only while it covers the requirement and its code, tests,
  config, role, and environment; otherwise the gap stays open.
Load events, restatement, self-reported compliance, and a clean worktree never prove a
requirement is met.

## Recovery
After a phase switch, requirement change, or context compaction, re-confirm decisions and
evidence from the Spec, Story, and records; anything whose source, implementation,
environment, or freshness stays unconfirmed keeps its item pending. A missing cache never
gates work, and reuse never waives an applicable requirement.

## Transition
Finishing one phase does not automatically authorize the next phase. Continue
into another phase only when the user's request includes it, such as Sprint, or
when the user explicitly invokes the next skill. A new session is optional.

## Completion
Report complete only when that phase's required outputs and evidence exist.
Missing evidence means incomplete-with-next-action, not a lock on reading,
diagnosis, implementation, testing, or repair.

## Interruption and Change
If the user interrupts, replaces the request, or changes a requirement, stop
the superseded work and follow the latest instruction. Update stale artifacts
when authorized; never force execution against a known-obsolete Spec or state.

## Exit
End with the achieved outcome, remaining evidence gaps, and the smallest useful
next action. Do not manufacture a handoff, background run, or separate session.

# Pr Contract

## Entry
- explicit pull-request request

## Inputs
- reviewable branch
- fresh test evidence

## Outputs
- reviewable PR

## Invariants
- push and PR creation require exact current authorization

## Completion Evidence
- summary, risk, and test evidence are complete

## Failure Semantics
- incomplete_continue

## Allowed Next
- none

## External Effects
- push
- pull request

# Git Workflow

Use the repository's established commit and branch conventions. Do not push,
create a pull request, tag, publish, or release without current authorization.
