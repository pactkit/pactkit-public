# Command: Release (v1.4.0)
- **Usage**: `/project-release`
- **Agent**: Repo Maintainer

## 🧠 Phase 0: Pre-flight Check
1.  **Version Detection**: Check if `pyproject.toml` version was changed vs the previous commit.
    - Run `git diff HEAD~1 pyproject.toml | grep version` (or vs branch base)
    - Capture the new version value (e.g., `1.4.1`).
    - If no version change is detected: print "ℹ️ No version bump detected. Update `pyproject.toml` version before releasing." Do not tag, publish, or create a release; safe release diagnosis remains available.
2.  **Read Config**: Read `.github/pactkit.yaml` to detect stack and release configuration.

## 🎬 Phase 1: Invoke pactkit-release Skill
1.  **Delegate to skill**: Invoke the `pactkit-release` skill with `VERSION={version}` from Phase 0.
    - The skill handles the full release protocol:
      Version Update → Spec Backfill → Architecture Snapshot → Git Operations → GitHub Release.
    - Pass the detected version so the skill skips its own auto-detection step.

## Rules Reference

# PDCA Lifecycle

## Entry
Activate a phase only when the user invokes its skill or explicitly asks for
that workflow. Resolve the current objective, project root, and relevant Story
from the current request and repository evidence; old run state is advisory.

## Execution
Work in the current conversation. Reuse valid evidence already produced in this
session. Do not repeat a completed step unless inputs changed or verification
shows a reason. Ask only when a missing decision would materially change the
result or authorize an external or destructive action.

## Reuse Classification
Before repeating a load, decision, or verification, classify what is available:
- Availability: content is present in context from a source still authoritative for this
  version; remembering a filename or a past read is not availability.
- Applicability: the change actually triggers the requirement; "simple task", an exhausted
  guide budget, and familiarity never justify skipping an applicable one.
- Decisions: a still-applicable decision may be reused; a decision is not verification.
- Evidence: reuse a verification only while it covers the requirement and its code, tests,
  config, role, and environment; otherwise the gap stays open.
Load events, restatement, self-reported compliance, and a clean worktree never prove a
requirement is met.

## Recovery
After a phase switch, requirement change, or context compaction, re-confirm decisions and
evidence from the Spec, Story, and records; anything whose source, implementation,
environment, or freshness stays unconfirmed keeps its item pending. A missing cache never
gates work, and reuse never waives an applicable requirement.

## Transition
Finishing one phase does not automatically authorize the next phase. Continue
into another phase only when the user's request includes it, such as Sprint, or
when the user explicitly invokes the next skill. A new session is optional.

## Completion
Report complete only when that phase's required outputs and evidence exist.
Missing evidence means incomplete-with-next-action, not a lock on reading,
diagnosis, implementation, testing, or repair.

## Interruption and Change
If the user interrupts, replaces the request, or changes a requirement, stop
the superseded work and follow the latest instruction. Update stale artifacts
when authorized; never force execution against a known-obsolete Spec or state.

## Exit
End with the achieved outcome, remaining evidence gaps, and the smallest useful
next action. Do not manufacture a handoff, background run, or separate session.

# Release Contract

## Entry
- explicit release request

## Inputs
- verified version
- changelog
- artifacts

## Outputs
- release-ready artifacts

## Invariants
- publishing requires exact current authorization

## Completion Evidence
- version and artifact provenance agree

## Failure Semantics
- incomplete_continue

## Allowed Next
- none

## External Effects
- tag
- publish
- release

# Git Workflow

Use the repository's established commit and branch conventions. Do not push,
create a pull request, tag, publish, or release without current authorization.
